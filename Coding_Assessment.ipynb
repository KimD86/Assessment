It shows that in and around St. James's PArk, where Newcastle play, there have been 9 reported in the stadium and the number is increasing the further away that you get from the stadium. The numbers are high in and around more housing estate areas, this indicates that people are being violent in their homes or other residences.\n",

There are a lot of pubs and clubs in the Newcastle town area where the supporters usually go after a match. The supporters are likely to be fuelling up with alcohol which has a big impact on the behaviour of some poeple."

        "From the data that has been analysed, it can be seen that there is a high number of violent offences when there are football games in the Newcastle area. Violent offences are the second highest crime type in the area over these months, they are second to anti-social behaviour. ASB is very high in the area too, this could also be an effect of having football games in the area. When attending football games, fans can become very emotional about the sport and if the team that they're there to see does not win then this can cause them to become violent towards not only other fans but also towards family members.\n",
        "From the data for all the football games it can be seen that violent offences are at the highest in the month's October and April in the 2020/2021 season. During these months there was 6 home games played at the Newcastle ground, during these months the numbers went up quite drastically for the offences which could support the hypothesis that on days where there are home football games, there are more violent offences in the area. Looking at the 2021/2022 season the month with the highest number of violent offences was March, in this month there was only one home game for this season. The question asked was whether violent offences are higher on home game months. In April there was the most home games played, and the number of violent offences was 24. This is a high number of offences, and this could help support the fact that the offences are higher when there are a lot of home games."
